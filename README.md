# This repository covers the following key AWS services:
Compute: EC2, Lambda
Storage: S3, EBS
Networking: VPC, Route 53
Database: RDS, DynamoDB
IAM & Security: IAM, CloudTrail, GuardDuty
Automation: CloudFormation, Terraform, CI/CD Pipelines
Each section is designed to provide hands-on experience through code, configuration files, and best practices for setting up AWS environments and automating infrastructure deployment.

# Prerequisites
To get started, youâ€™ll need:

An AWS account.
Basic knowledge of cloud computing and networking concepts.
